      February 12 & 13 @ 7 pm
      
      In this hilarious comedy by the author of Lend Me a Tenor and Moon Over 
      Buffalo, two English Shakespearean actors, Jack and Leo, find themselves 
      so down on their luck that they are performing “Scenes from Shakespeare” 
      on the Moose Lodge circuit in the Amish country of Pennsylvania.  When 
      they hear that an old lady in York, PA is about to die and leave her 
      fortune to her two long lost English nephews, they resolve to pass 
      themselves off as her beloved relatives and get the cash.  The trouble 
      is, when they get to York, they find out that the relatives aren’t nephews, 
      but nieces!  Romantic entanglements abound, especially when Leo falls 
      head-over-petticoat in love with the old lady’s vivacious nice, Meg. who’s 
      engaged to the local minister.  Meg knows that there’s a wide world out there, 
      but it’s not until she meets “Maxine and Stephanie” that she finally gets a 
      taste of it.  Tickets available at https://www.localevelevents.com/events/details/1461
